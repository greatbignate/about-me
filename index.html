    <p>My name is Zahra Mohamed.I am currently working on obtaining a developer position. I have taken many steps words this career path. One of the steps I have taken is to start a training program called Code Fellows that will instill in me certain skills regarding software development.There are a total of three classes which should take me about 6 months to complete. I was a research coordinator before this and so I am going into this career path with no coding skills at all! This makes me nervouse but I am ready for the challenge ahead.</p>
